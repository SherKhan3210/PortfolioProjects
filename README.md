# NBA Project
I created 3 tables using excel:
- One for the defensive and offensive ratings of NBA teams from 1992-2022
- One for the field goal/three point attempts of NBA teams from 2012-2022
- One for the shooting percentages by zone of NBA teams from 2012-2022

What I found was that over the past ten years the average offensive rating (points scored per 100 possessions) has risen consistently. 
I hypothesized that this was due to an increase in three point shooting. What I found was that from 2012-2022 there has been an aggressive 
increase in the overall percentage of field goal attempts that were three point shots. In 2012 of all field goals attempted about 22.5% of 
them were from three, while in 2022 that number has risen to almost 40%. I then looked that the efficiency of  shots by calculating the points 
per attempt (I used the field goal percentage from each zone and multiplied it to the amount of points that the shot would yield). What I found 
is that after points in the restricted area the next three most efficient shots to take were all three pointers (right corner three, left corner 
three, above the break three). These shots were far more efficient than shots in the paint and shots from mid range, meaning that as the volume 
of three point shots went up, so too would the points scored per 100 possessions. If teams can utilize these statistics they could draw up plays 
that substantially increase their chances of taking either shots in the restricted area or shots from behind the three point line, while minimized 
the amount of shots they take in the more inefficient zones. This could lead to an increase in offensive efficiency and in turn more wins for a given team.
